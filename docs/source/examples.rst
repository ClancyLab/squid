Examples
==============================

On the squid github repo, we include an examples folder that describes simple use cases.  These are replicated here:

	- :doc:`Using NEB to find the MEP of CNH Isomerization <./examples/neb>`
	- :doc:`Calculating and visualizing the molecular orbitals of Water <./examples/water_mo>`
	- :doc:`Calculating and visualizing the electrostatic potential surface of Water <./examples/water_eps>`
	- :doc:`Using procrustes and linear interpolation to smooth out a predicted reaction pathway <./examples/smooth_xyz>`
	- :doc:`Equilibrating a box of benzene and acetone in Molecular Dynamics <./examples/md_box>`
